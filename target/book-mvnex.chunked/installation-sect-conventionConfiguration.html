      <p>Convention over configuration is a simple concept: Systems, libraries,
and frameworks should assume reasonable defaults. Without requiring
unnecessary configuration, systems should “just work”. Popular
frameworks such as <a class="ulink" href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" target="_top">Ruby on Rails</a> and EJB3
have started to adhere to these principles in reaction to the
configuration complexity of frameworks such as the initial EJB 2.1
specifications. An illustration of convention over configuration is
something like EJB3 persistence: all you need to do to make a
particular bean persistent is to annotate that class with @Entity.
The framework assumes table and column names based on the name of the
class and the names of the properties. Hooks are provided for you to
override these default, assumed names if the need arises, but, in most
cases, you will find that using the framework-supplied defaults
results in a faster project execution.</p>
      <p>Maven incorporates this concept by providing sensible default behavior
for projects. Without customization, source code is assumed to be in
<code class="literal">${basedir}/src/main/java</code> and resources are assumed to be in
<code class="literal">${basedir}/src/main/resources</code>. Tests are assumed to be in
<code class="literal">${basedir}/src/test</code>, and a project is assumed to produce a JAR
file. Maven assumes that you want the compile bytecode to
<code class="literal">${basedir}/target/classes</code> and then create a distributable JAR file
in <code class="literal">${basedir}/target</code>. While this might seem trivial, consider the
fact that most Ant-based builds have to define the locations of these
directories. Ant doesn’t ship with any built-in idea of where source
code or resources might be in a project; you have to supply this
information. Maven’s adoption of convention over configuration goes
farther than just simple directory locations. Maven’s core plugins
apply a common set of conventions for compiling source code, packaging
distributions, generating web sites, and many other processes. Maven’s
strength comes from the fact that it is “opinionated”; it has a
defined life-cycle and a set of common plugins that know how to build
and assemble software. If you follow the conventions, Maven will
require almost zero effort - just put your source in the correct
directory, and Maven will take care of the rest.</p>
      <p>One side effect of using systems that follow “convention over
configuration” is that end-users might feel that they are forced to
use a particular methodology or approach. While it is certainly true
that Maven has some core opinions that shouldn’t be challenged, most
of the defaults can be customized. For example, the location of a
project’s source code and resources can be customized, names of JAR
files can be customized, and through the development of custom
plugins, almost any behavior can be tailored to your specific
environment’s requirements. If you don’t care to follow convention,
Maven will allow you to customize defaults in order to adapt to your
specific requirements.</p>
