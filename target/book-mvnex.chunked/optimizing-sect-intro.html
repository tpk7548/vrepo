      <p>In <a class="xref" href="multimodule-web-spring.html" title="Chapter 7. Multi-Module Enterprise Project">Chapter 7, <em>Multi-Module Enterprise Project</em></a>, we showed how many pieces of Maven come
together to produce a fully functional multimodule build. Although the
example from that chapter suggests a real application—one that
interacts with a database, a web service, and that itself presents two
interfaces: one in a web application, and one on the command line—that
example project is still contrived. To present the complexity of a
real project would require a book far larger than the one you are now
reading. Real-life applications evolve over years and are often
maintained by large, diverse groups of developers, each with a
different focus. In a real-world project, you are often evaluating
decisions and designs made and created by others. In this chapter, we
take a step back from the examples you’ve seen in the previous
chapters, and we ask ourselves if there are any optimizations that
might make more sense given what we now know about Maven. Maven is a
very capable tool that can be as simple or as complex as you need it
to be. Because of this, there are often a million ways to accomplish
the same task, and there is often no one “right” way to configure your
Maven project.</p>
      <p>Don’t misinterpret that last sentence as a license to go off and ask
Maven to do something it wasn’t designed for. While Maven allows for a
diversity of approach, there is certainly “A Maven Way”, and you’ll be
more productive using Maven as it was designed to be used. All this
chapter is trying to do is communicate some of the optimizations you
can perform on an existing Maven project. Why didn’t we just introduce
an optimized POM in the first place? Designing POMs for pedagogy is a
very different requirement from designing POMs for efficiency. While
it is certainly much easier to define a certain setting in your
<code class="literal">~/.m2/settings.xml</code> than to declare a profile in a <code class="literal">pom.xml</code>, writing
a book, and reading a book is mostly about pacing and making sure
we’re not introducing concepts before you are ready. In the previous
chapters, we’ve made an effort not to overwhelm the reader with too
much information, and, in doing so, we’ve skipped some core concepts
like the <code class="literal">dependencyManagement</code> element introduced in this chapter.</p>
      <p>There are many instances in the previous chapters when the authors of
this book took a shortcut or glossed over an important detail to
shuffle you along to the main point of a specific chapter. You learned
how to create a Maven project, and you compiled and installed it
without having to wade through hundreds of pages introducing every
last switch and dial available to you. We’ve done this because we
believe it is important to deliver the new Maven user to a result
faster rather than meandering our way through a very long, seemingly
interminable story. Once you’ve started to use Maven, you should know
how to analyze your own projects and POMs. In this chapter, we take a
step back and look at what we are left with after the example from
<a class="xref" href="multimodule-web-spring.html" title="Chapter 7. Multi-Module Enterprise Project">Chapter 7, <em>Multi-Module Enterprise Project</em></a>.</p>
