      <p>On larger projects, additional dependencies often tend to creep into a
POM as the number of dependencies grow. As dependencies change, you
are often left with dependencies that are not being used, and just as
often, you may forget to declare explicit dependencies for libraries
you require. Because Maven 2.x includes transitive dependencies in the
compile scope, your project may compile properly but fail to run in
production. Consider a case where a project uses classes from a widely
used project such as Jakarta Commons BeanUtils. Instead of declaring
an explicit dependency on BeanUtils, your project simply relies on a
project like Hibernate that references BeanUtils as a transitive
dependency. Your project may compile successfully and run just fine,
but if you upgrade to a new version of Hibernate that doesn’t depend
on BeanUtils, you’ll start to get compile and runtime errors, and it
won’t be immediately obvious why your project stopped compiling. Also,
because you haven’t explicitly listed a dependency version, Maven
cannot resolve any version conflicts that may arise.</p>
      <p>A good rule of thumb in Maven is to always declare explicit
dependencies for classes referenced in your code. If you are going to
be importing Commons BeanUtils classes, you should also be declaring a
direct dependency on Commons BeanUtils. Fortunately, via bytecode
analysis, the Maven Dependency plugin is able to assist you in
uncovering direct references to dependencies. Using the updated POMs
we previously optimized, let’s look to see if any errors pop up:</p>

      <p>In the truncated output just shown, you can see the output of the
<code class="literal">dependency:analyze</code> goal. This goal analyzes the project to see
whether there are any indirect dependencies, or dependencies that are
being referenced but are not directly declared. In the <code class="literal">simple-model</code>
project, the Dependency plugin indicates a “used undeclared
dependency” on <code class="literal">javax.persistence:persistence-api</code>. To investigate
further, go to the <code class="literal">simple-model</code> directory and run the
<code class="literal">dependency:tree</code> goal, which will list all of the project’s direct
and transitive dependencies:</p>

      <p>From this output, we can see that the <code class="literal">persistence-api</code> dependency is
coming from <code class="literal">hibernate</code>. A cursory scan of the source in this module
will reveal many <code class="literal">javax.persistence</code> import statements confirming that
we are, indeed, directly referencing this dependency. The simple fix
is to add a direct reference to the dependency. In this example, we
put the dependency version in <code class="literal">simple-parent</code>'s <code class="literal">dependencyManagement</code>
section because the dependency is linked to Hibernate, and the
Hibernate version is declared here. Eventually you are going to want
to upgrade your project’s version of Hibernate. Listing the
<code class="literal">persistence-api</code> dependency version near the Hibernate dependency
version will make it more obvious later when your team modifies the
parent POM to upgrade the Hibernate version.</p>
      <p>If you look at the <code class="literal">dependency:analyze</code> output from the <code class="literal">simple-web</code>
module, you will see that we also need to add a direct reference to
the <code class="literal">simple-model</code> dependency. The code in <code class="literal">simple-webapp</code> directly
references the model objects in <code class="literal">simple-model</code>, and the <code class="literal">simple-model</code>
is exposed to <code class="literal">simple-webapp</code> as a transitive dependency via
<code class="literal">simple-persist</code>. Since this is a sibling dependency that shares both
the <code class="literal">version</code> and <code class="literal">groupId</code>, the dependency can be defined in
<code class="literal">simple-webapp</code>'s <code class="literal">pom.xml</code> using the <code class="literal">${project.groupId}</code> and
<code class="literal">${project.version}</code>.</p>
      <p>How did the Maven Dependency plugin uncover these issues? How does
<code class="literal">dependency:analyze</code> know which classes and dependencies are directly
referenced by your project’s bytecode? The Dependency plugin uses the
ObjectWeb ASM (<a class="ulink" href="http://asm.objectweb.org/" target="_top">http://asm.objectweb.org/</a>) library
to produce a list of “used, undeclared dependencies” dependencies</p>
      <p>In contrast, the list of unused, declared dependencies is a little
trickier to validate, and less useful than the “used, undeclared
dependencies.” For one, some dependencies are used only at runtime or
for tests, and they won’t be found in the bytecode. These are pretty
obvious when you see them in the output; for example, JUnit appears in
this list, but this is expected because it is used only for unit
tests. You’ll also notice that the Velocity and Servlet API
dependencies are listed in this list for the <code class="literal">simple-web</code> module. This
is also expected because, although the project doesn’t have any direct
references to the classes of these artifacts, they are still essential
during runtime.</p>
      <p>Be careful when removing any unused, declared dependencies unless you
have very good test coverage, or you might introduce a runtime
error. A more sinister issue pops up with bytecode optimization. For
example, it is legal for a compiler to substitute the value of a
constant and optimize away the reference. Removing this dependency
will cause the compile to fail, yet the tool shows it as
unused. Future versions of the Maven Dependency plugin will provide
better techniques for detecting and/or ignoring these types of issues.</p>
      <p>You should use the <code class="literal">dependency:analyze</code> tool periodically to detect
these common errors in your projects. It can be configured to fail the
build if certain conditions are found, and it is also available as a
report.</p>
