      <p>Plugins are more than just a trick to minimize the download size of the
Maven distribution. Plugins add new behavior to your project’s build.
Maven retrieves both dependencies and plugins from the remote repository,
allowing for universal reuse of build logic.</p>
      <p>The Maven Surefire plugin is the plugin that is responsible for
running unit tests. Somewhere between version 1.0 and the version that
is in wide use today someone decided to add support for the TestNG
unit testing framework in addition to the support for JUnit. This
upgrade happened in a way that didn’t break backwards
compatibility. If you were using the Surefire plugin to compile and
execute JUnit 3 unit tests, and you upgraded to the most recent
version of the Surefire plugin, your tests continued to execute
without fail. But, you gained new functionality; if you want to
execute unit tests in TestNG you now have that ability. You also
gained the ability to run annotated JUnit 4 unit tests. You gained all
of these capabilities without having to upgrade your Maven
installation or install new software. Most importantly, nothing about
your project had to change aside from a version number for a plugin in a
single Maven configuration file called the Project Object Model (POM).</p>
      <p>It is this mechanism that affects much more than the Surefire
plugin. Maven has plugins for everything from compiling Java code, to
generating reports, to deploying to an application server. Maven has
abstracted common build tasks into plugins which are maintained
centrally and shared universally. If the state-of-the-art changes in
any area of the build, if some new unit testing framework is released
or if some new tool is made available, you don’t have to be the one to
hack your project’s custom build system to support it. You benefit
from the fact that plugins are downloaded from a remote repository and
maintained centrally. This is what is meant by universal reuse through
Maven plugins.</p>
