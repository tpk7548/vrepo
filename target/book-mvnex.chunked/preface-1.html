      <p>Maven is a build tool, a project management tool, an abstract
container for running build tasks. It is a tool that has shown itself
indispensable for projects that graduate beyond the simple and need to
start finding consistent ways to manage and build large collections of
interdependent modules and libraries which make use of tens or
hundreds of third-party components. It is a tool that has removed much
of the burden of third-party dependency management from the daily work
schedule of millions of engineers, and it has enabled many
organizations to evolve beyond the toil and struggle of build
management into a new phase where the effort required to build and
maintain software is no longer a limiting factor in software design.</p>
      <p>This work is the first attempt at a comprehensive title on Maven. It
builds upon the combined experience and work of the authors of all
previous Maven titles, and you should view it not as a finished work
but as the first edition in a long line of updates to follow. While
Maven has been around for a few years, the authors of this book
believe that it has just begun to deliver on the audacious promises it
makes. The authors, and company behind this book,
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sonatype.com" target="_top">Sonatype</a>, believe that the publishing of this
book marks the beginning of a new phase of innovation and development
surrounding Maven and the software ecosystem that surrounds it.</p>
