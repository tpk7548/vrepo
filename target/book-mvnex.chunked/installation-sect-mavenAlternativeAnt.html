      <p>So, sure, Maven is an alternative to Ant, but
<a class="ulink" href="http://ant.apache.org" target="_top">Apache Ant</a> continues to be a great, widely-used
tool. It has been the reigning champion of Java builds for years, and
you can integrate Ant build scripts with your project’s Maven build
very easily. This is a common usage pattern for a Maven project. On
the other hand, as more and more open source projects move to Maven as
a project management platform, working developers are starting to
realize that Maven not only simplifies the task of build management,
it is helping to encourage a common interface between developers and
software projects. Maven is more of a platform than a tool, while you
could consider Maven an alternative to Ant, you are comparing apples
to oranges. “Maven” includes more than just a build tool.</p>
      <p>This is the central point that makes all of the Maven vs. Ant, Maven
vs. Buildr, Maven vs. Gradle arguments irrelevant. Maven isn’t totally
defined by the mechanics of your build system. It isn’t about
scripting the various tasks in your build as much as it is about
encouraging a set of standards, a common interface, a life-cycle, a
standard repository format, a standard directory layout, etc. It
certainly isn’t about what format the POM happens to be in (XML
vs. YAML vs. Ruby). Maven is much larger than that, and Maven refers
to much more than the tool itself. When this book talks of Maven, it
is referring to the constellation of software, systems, and standards
that support it. Buildr, Ivy, Gradle, all of these tools interact with
the repository format that Maven helped create, and you could just as
easily use a repository manager like Nexus to support a build written
entirely in Ant.</p>
      <p>While Maven is an alternative to many of these tools, the community
needs to evolve beyond seeing technology as a zero-sum game between
unfriendly competitors in a competition for users and developers. This
might be how large corporations relate to one another, but it has very
little relevance to the way that open source communities work. The
headline “Who’s winning? Ant or Maven?” isn’t very constructive. If
you force us to answer this question, we’re definitely going to say
that Maven is a superior alternative to Ant as a foundational
technology for a build; at the same time, Maven’s boundaries are
constantly shifting and the Maven community is constantly trying to
seek out new ways to become more ecumenical, more inter-operable, more
cooperative. The core tenets of Maven are declarative builds,
dependency management, repository managers, and universal reuse through
plugins, but the specific incarnation of these ideas at any given
moment is less important than the sense that the open source community
is collaborating to reduce the inefficiency of “enterprise-scale
builds”.</p>
